# LangGraph Platform Deployment Task List

## Project Goal
Deploy a simple LangGraph application with 1 node (conversation agent using OpenAI GPT-4o) to serve as a test backend for a frontend chat UI.

## Prerequisites
- ✅ .env file with correct attributes (already exists)
- ✅ Python 3.11 virtual environment setup
- ✅ LangSmith account access

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
1. **Set up Python virtual environment**
   - [x] Create Python 3.11 virtual environment in project root
   - [x] Activate the virtual environment
   - [x] Verify Python version is 3.11

2. **Create project directory structure**
   - [x] Create `my_agent/` subdirectory
   - [x] Create `my_agent/__init__.py` (empty file to mark as Python package)
   - [x] Create `my_agent/agent.py` (main graph implementation)
   - [x] Verify `.env` file exists in root directory

3. **Create configuration files**
   - [x] Create `requirements.txt` in root directory
   - [x] Create `langgraph.json` configuration file
   - [x] Ensure proper file structure matches LangGraph requirements

### Phase 2: Graph Implementation
4. **Implement simple conversation agent**
   - [x] Import required modules (langgraph, langchain_openai)
   - [x] Define AgentState class for graph state management
   - [x] Create single node function that uses OpenAI GPT-4o
   - [x] Build StateGraph with one node
   - [x] Compile graph and assign to `graph` variable
   - [x] Ensure proper error handling and response formatting

5. **Configure dependencies**
   - [x] Add `langgraph` to requirements.txt
   - [x] Add `langchain_openai` to requirements.txt
   - [x] Add any additional required packages
   - [x] Specify exact versions for stability

6. **Install LangGraph CLI for local testing**
   - [x] Install `langgraph-cli` package
   - [x] Verify CLI installation and available commands
   - [x] Test graph in LangGraph Studio locally using `langgraph dev`

### Phase 3: Environment Configuration
7. **Verify environment setup**
   - [x] Confirm `.env` file contains `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - [x] Add any additional required environment variables
   - [x] Test environment variable loading in development

8. **Create LangGraph configuration**
   - [x] Configure `langgraph.json` with proper dependencies path
   - [x] Set graph reference to `./my_agent/agent.py:graph`
   - [x] Link environment file reference
   - [x] Validate JSON syntax

### Phase 4: Version Control Setup
9. **Initialize Git repository**
   - [x] Run `git init` in project directory
   - [x] Create `.gitignore` file (exclude .env, __pycache__, etc.)
   - [x] Add all project files to Git
   - [x] Create initial commit

10. **Set up GitHub repository**
    - [x] Create new repository on GitHub
    - [x] Add remote origin to local repository
    - [x] Push code to GitHub main branch
    - [x] Verify all files are properly uploaded

### Phase 5: LangGraph Platform Deployment
11. **Deploy to LangGraph Platform**
    - [ ] Log into LangSmith account
    - [ ] Navigate to "Deployments" section
    - [ ] Click "+ New Deployment"
    - [ ] Connect GitHub account (if first time)
    - [ ] Select the created repository
    - [ ] Submit deployment request
    - [ ] Monitor deployment status (15+ minutes)

12. **Verify deployment**
    - [ ] Check deployment status in LangSmith dashboard
    - [ ] Access LangGraph Studio to visualize the graph
    - [ ] Test the deployed graph functionality
    - [ ] Retrieve API endpoint URL for frontend integration

### Phase 6: API Integration Testing
13. **Test API endpoint**
    - [ ] Copy API URL from deployment details
    - [ ] Test API with sample requests
    - [ ] Verify response format matches frontend expectations
    - [ ] Document API usage for frontend team

14. **Frontend integration preparation**
    - [ ] Provide API endpoint URL
    - [ ] Document expected request/response format
    - [ ] Create sample API calls for frontend testing
    - [ ] Set up monitoring for API health

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Graph successfully deployed to LangGraph Platform
- ✅ API endpoint accessible and responding correctly
- ✅ Single conversation agent using OpenAI GPT-4o working
- ✅ Frontend can make successful API calls
- ✅ Back-and-forth conversation simulation functional

## Notes
- Deployment typically takes 15+ minutes
- Monitor LangSmith dashboard for deployment status
- Keep API endpoint URL secure for frontend integration
- Test thoroughly before frontend integration
